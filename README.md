# Online Console Options

An introduction to console options when starting out.

Code simulators and consoles are a great tool for creating pieces of code and debugging purposes.

There are many different options to suit your coding requirements. Here are some popular suggestions with pros and cons for each. 

There are 3 key points to take into consideration with these platforms:
