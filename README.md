# Online Console Options

An introduction to console options when starting out.

Code simulators and consoles are a great tool for creating pieces of code and debugging purposes. 
<br>These tools are particularly useful when solving Codewars katas.

There are many different options to suit your coding requirements. Here are some popular suggestions with pros and cons for each. 

There are 3 key points to take into consideration with these platforms:

  1. What coding languages do they support?
  2. Do they simply help debug through syntax checking or can you run code and check the result in a console?
  3. Do you have to set up an account to use them?
